# About this challenge

 In this challenge it was asked to visualize earthquake data from all around the world from United States Geological Survey (USGS).
 The visualization was created by choosing a dataset from USGS website https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson.
 It was in a JSON format. 

 The visualization was created a JavaScript library d3 and Leaflet. All the eqrthquakes  are marked on the map using longitude and latitude.
 Earthquakes with higher magnitude their markers are larger in size and the greater the depth the colour gets darker for the marker. This was all doen along with css and html.

# Repo Structure

  Please refer to:-
  Leaflet-Part-1 folder inside, it there is another folder with name static,  that has all the javascript code under folder js, with file name logic.js

# Usage

  To view the webpage with earthquake visualization run html file in default browser.

# Acknowledgments 

This challenge was indeed very challenging due to extensive coding of the javascript functions and given the fact that there are many variations in doing same thing. This assignmnet would have not been able to finish if i do not have the help of tutor to guide me how to begin writing the code and showing me how the end results will look like. Later when I got stuck with creating legend I got help from Learning Assistance. Therefore, I would like to thank them for there support.
